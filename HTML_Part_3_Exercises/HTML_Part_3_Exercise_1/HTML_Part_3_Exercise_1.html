    <h1>Is Google your best friend?</h1>
    <p>Google, from brand name to verb was just a small step. The correct spelling is google, with -el- and without a capital letter. The spelling of English verbs of which the end syllable of the infinitive is spelled with the syllable combination -le (to google), is adjusted in Dutch. Verbs derived from a proper name (Google) are written with a lowercase letter.</p>
