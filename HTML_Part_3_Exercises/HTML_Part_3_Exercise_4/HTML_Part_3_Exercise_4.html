    <h1>Part 3 exercise 4</h1>

    <h2>Working correctly with images</h2>
    <p>Good web design is more than just technique. You have to develop a feeling for good images and stylish designs and you have to be able to create a site not only locally but also online for a customer. Your end result has to be eye-catching and that involves a lot.</p>

    <p>The portrait right is the right of a person portrayed to oppose publication of their portrait in certain cases. In this context, 'portrait' is understood to mean any visible representation on which a person is recognizably depicted, for example in a photograph, painting, drawing or in film images. If more than one person is shown in a photo or film, each of them has the portrait right.
    </p>
    <p>Actually, you could say that the portrait right is a kind of exclusive right to your own image. By this we mean that others are not allowed to depict a person without their explicit permission. That rule applies not only to photographers or camera crews, but also to painters, sculptors or other graphic artists who want to depict an existing person. If you want to take a picture of a certain person, or you want to film him or her, you will, in principle, have to obtain that person's permission beforehand. If he or she refuses, you will not be able to continue your photo session or video recording.</p>

    <p>Many beginners in photography place the subject of a photo right in the middle. As long as the picture is sharp and the subject is recognizable, this is certainly not wrong, but there is as much more as possible. How do you capture the subject in such a way that it also becomes a beautiful, creative, or interesting photo? Why is one picture better than another and why do certain pictures score better?</p>
